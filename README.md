# zx-specdrum-re-created
Recreated and improved version of Currah Specdrum Interface for ZX Spectrum

Work on this was initiated because existing schema found on the internet is with errors.

# Version 1
First version is more or less a 1:1 copy of the original interface. With help I got the correct values and type for all the Capacitors. The only changes compared with original:
* PCB made more compact to fit into my ZX-Bus-Extender board, you can use a normal edge connecter if you prefer.
* Some components moved, all ICs now have the same orientation.
* Make sure all ICs have decoupling capacitors.
* Added a 3.5" mini-jack plug for audio out.

BOM:


## This is how version 1 turned out
